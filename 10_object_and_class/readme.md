# OOP

# class in c++
## how to write a class
## member variables and member functions
## access control
## *const* memeber function
void stock::show const //promises not to change invoking object
## class contructors and destructors
## *this* pointer represent the invoked object
## an array of objects

# class scope
you must use the direct memebership operator(.), the indirect membership operator(->), or the scope-resolution operator(::), depending on the context, when you use a class member name

# abstract data type
as ADT describes a data type in a general fashion without bring in language orimplementation details. for example. the stack, you can store data so that data is wlways is added to or delete from the top of the stack.

c++ programs use a stack to manage automatic variables. for example:
* you can create an empty stack.
* you can add an item to the top of a stack(that is you can push an item)
* you can remove an item from the top(that is you can pop an item)
* you can check whether the stack is full.
* you can check whether the stack is empty
